# bot-leave
a simple little script i use to remove my bots from servers

adds a classic command ($eject) to discord bots temporarily to allow the bot owner to remove the bot from servers

# WARNING!
this program has absolutely no userid filtering. if a user knows your bot is running this script, they can remove your bot from servers too.
